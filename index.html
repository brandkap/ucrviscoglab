      <h3>
        The visual cognition lab at the University of California, Riverside is
        concerned with understanding the perceptual, attentional, and cognitive
        limitations in the performance of complex perceptual tasks. This work
        has three primary directions. One direction is concerned with examining
        perceptual tasks associated with real-world applications, specifically
        driving performance, with a particular focus on predicting and
        preventing accident risk among older drivers. To address this issue we
        have conducted experiments examining a wide range of perceptual tasks
        (e.g., steering control, collision avoidance, visual search) using a
        custom driving simulator coded from scratch in our lab.
        <h3>
          Our current research is examining the effectiveness of cognitive,
          perceptual, and attentional measures as predictors for decreased
          driving skill for the elderly. The second direction is concerned with
          examining tasks associated with the perception of scenes. Our research
          on this issue has included examining limitations in attention in
          three-dimensional displays and the role of texture in the perception
          of objects in scenes. The third direction examines possible
          interventions to age-related perceptual declines. This work has
          examined perceptual learning for low-level, as well as high-level
          visual features. Our more recent work has examined age-related changes
          in multimodal integration and will soon examine perceptual learning in
          the context of multisensory integration.
